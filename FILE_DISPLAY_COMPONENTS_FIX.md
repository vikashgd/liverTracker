# File Display Components Fix

## Problem
The report detail page was showing a runtime error:
```
Runtime ReferenceError: FileImageDisplay is not defined
```

The components `FileImageDisplay`, `FilePdfDisplay`, and `FileDownloadDisplay` were being used but not defined or imported.

## Solution

### 1. Created File Display Components
**File:** `web/src/components/file-display-components.tsx`

Created three specialized components for handling different file types:

#### FileImageDisplay
- Displays medical report images with proper loading states
- Handles image loading errors gracefully
- Provides download functionality
- Shows image previews with responsive sizing

#### FilePdfDisplay  
- Integrates with existing PDFViewer component
- Provides both view and download options
- Shows PDF placeholder with action buttons
- Opens full PDF viewer in modal overlay

#### FileDownloadDisplay
- Handles other file types (text, Word, Excel, etc.)
- Shows appropriate file type icons
- Provides direct download functionality
- Displays file type information

### 2. Added File API Endpoint
**File:** `web/src/app/api/files/[...path]/route.ts`

Created API endpoint to serve files from Google Cloud Storage:
- Handles dynamic file paths
- Generates signed URLs for secure access
- Redirects to GCS signed URLs
- Proper error handling for missing files

### 3. Enhanced GCS Storage Helper
**File:** `web/src/lib/storage/gcs.ts`

Added helper function:
```typescript
export async function getSignedUrl(objectKey: string): Promise<string | null>
```
- Simplifies getting signed URLs for file access
- Handles errors gracefully
- Returns null for missing files

### 4. Fixed Imports
**File:** `web/src/app/reports/[id]/report-detail-client.tsx`

Added missing import:
```typescript
import { FileImageDisplay, FilePdfDisplay, FileDownloadDisplay } from "@/components/file-display-components";
```

## Layout Integration

The file display components are now properly integrated into the report detail page layout:

**Right Column Structure:**
1. **Parameter Trending** - Charts showing lab value changes over time
2. **Original Report File** - Display of the uploaded medical report file

This provides users with:
- Lab data analysis on the left
- Trending charts on the right top  
- Original source document on the right bottom

## Testing

The fix resolves the runtime error and provides a complete file display system that:
- Handles all common medical report file types
- Provides appropriate viewing experiences for each type
- Maintains security through signed URLs
- Offers graceful error handling

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The file display components are now fully functional and integrated into the report detail page without any runtime errors.
