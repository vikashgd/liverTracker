## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Cannot Connect from Other Device**
```bash
# Check if app is running with network binding
netstat -an | grep 3000
# Should show: *.3000 or 0.0.0.0:3000
```

**2. App Starts but Shows Error**
- Ensure you're using `npm run dev:network` not `npm run dev`
- Check firewall settings
- Verify IP address is correct

**3. Slow Loading**
- This is normal for development mode
- For faster access, use production mode:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run start:network
  ```

**4. Authentication Issues**
- Clear browser cache on the accessing device
- Ensure both devices use same network time

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check what's listening on port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Test connectivity from another device
ping YOUR_MAC_IP

# Check network interface
ifconfig en0    # Usually WiFi interface
```

## üöÄ Advanced Setup

### Custom Port
If port 3000 is busy:
```bash
# Edit package.json
"dev:network": "next dev --turbopack -H 0.0.0.0 -p 3001"
```

### HTTPS Setup (Optional)
For secure connections:
1. Generate self-signed certificate
2. Modify Next.js config
3. Access via `https://YOUR_IP:3000`

### Router Configuration
For access from outside your local network:
1. Set up port forwarding on your router
2. Configure dynamic DNS
3. Use VPN for secure remote access
