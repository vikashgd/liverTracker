# üö® NEON DATABASE USAGE ANALYSIS - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

## üí∞ COST BREAKDOWN
- **Usage:** 254.5 compute units √ó $0.14 = **$35.63**
- **Scale:** Only 10 accounts with 50 reports
- **Problem:** This is **EXTREMELY HIGH** for such low usage

## üîç ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### 1. üö® CRITICAL: Multiple PrismaClient Instances
**MAJOR LEAK:** You're creating new PrismaClient instances in API routes instead of using connection pooling.

**Problem Files:**
- `web/src/app/api/reports/route.ts` - Creates `new PrismaClient()` for EVERY request
- `web/src/app/api/profile/route.ts` - Creates fresh client per request
- `web/src/app/api/chart-data/route.ts` - Creates fresh client per request
- `web/src/app/api/fix-onboarding/route.ts` - Creates fresh client per request

**Impact:** Each API call creates a new database connection instead of reusing pooled connections.

### 2. üö® CRITICAL: Aggressive Database Warmup
**Problem:** Database warmup runs every 4 minutes continuously.

**Files:**
- `web/src/lib/db-warmup.ts` - `setInterval` every 4 minutes
- `web/src/app/layout.tsx` - Auto-imports warmup on EVERY page load
- `web/src/lib/warmup.ts` - Runs on both server and client side

**Impact:** 
- Server: Continuous queries every 4 minutes = 360 queries/day just for warmup
- Client: Additional warmup on every page visit

### 3. üö® HIGH: Connection Leaks in API Routes
**Problem:** API routes create connections but may not always disconnect properly.

**Example from `reports/route.ts`:**
```typescript
const prisma = new PrismaClient(); // NEW CONNECTION EVERY TIME
try {
  // ... queries
} finally {
  await prisma.$disconnect(); // May fail silently
}
```

### 4. üö® MEDIUM: Inefficient Query Patterns
**Problem:** Multiple separate queries instead of optimized joins.

**Example:** User validation + data fetch = 2 queries instead of 1

## üìä ESTIMATED IMPACT

### Current Wasteful Pattern:
- **Warmup queries:** 360/day √ó 30 days = 10,800 queries/month
- **API connection overhead:** Each request creates new connection
- **Connection pool exhaustion:** Forces Neon to spin up more compute

### Expected Usage (10 users, 50 reports):
- **Normal queries:** ~1,000-2,000/month
- **Current queries:** Likely 15,000-20,000/month due to leaks

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Fix PrismaClient Usage (CRITICAL)
Replace all `new PrismaClient()` in API routes with shared instance:
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'; // Use shared instance
```

### 2. Reduce Warmup Frequency (CRITICAL)
Change from 4 minutes to 30+ minutes or disable entirely:
```typescript
const WARMUP_INTERVAL = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes instead of 4
```

### 3. Remove Client-Side Warmup (HIGH)
Remove warmup from layout.tsx - only server needs it.

### 4. Optimize Queries (MEDIUM)
Combine user validation with data fetching in single queries.

## üí° EXPECTED SAVINGS
Fixing these issues should reduce your Neon usage by **80-90%**, bringing costs down to **$3-7/month** instead of $35+.

## üéØ PRIORITY ORDER
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Stop creating new PrismaClient instances
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Reduce warmup frequency 
3. **HIGH:** Remove client-side warmup
4. **MEDIUM:** Optimize query patterns

This analysis shows your high costs are due to **database connection leaks and excessive warmup queries**, not actual application usage.
