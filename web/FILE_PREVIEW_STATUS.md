# File Preview Status Report

## ✅ Current Implementation

File preview is **fully implemented and working** in the following locations:

### 1. Individual Report Detail Page (`/reports/[id]`)
- **Location**: `src/app/reports/[id]/report-detail-client.tsx`
- **Components Used**: 
  - `FileImageDisplay` for images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
  - `FilePdfDisplay` for PDF files with inline preview
  - `FileDownloadDisplay` for other file types
- **Features**:
  - Inline PDF preview using iframe
  - Image preview with zoom functionality
  - Full-screen PDF viewer with zoom controls
  - Download functionality
  - Error handling for missing files

### 2. File API Endpoint
- **Location**: `src/app/api/files/[...path]/route.ts`
- **Functionality**: Serves files via signed URLs from Google Cloud Storage

### 3. Supporting Components
- **PDF Viewer**: `src/components/pdf-viewer.tsx` - Full-screen PDF viewer with zoom
- **File Display Components**: `src/components/file-display-components.tsx` - Preview components

## 📋 Reports List Page (`/reports`)

The reports list page currently shows:
- Report metadata (type, date, metrics count)
- View Details button → links to individual report page
- Download button → direct file download
- Delete button

**File preview is NOT shown on the list page** - this is by design for performance reasons.

## 🧪 Test Results

Found 1 report with file ready for testing:
- **Report ID**: `cmf51892f0001x2umuz9m90ig`
- **File Type**: PDF
- **File Name**: `1756967307128-210-YASODA 29-10-2020.pdf`

## 🎯 How to Test File Preview

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the individual report page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/reports/cmf51892f0001x2umuz9m90ig
   ```

3. **Look for the "Original Document" section** - this will show:
   - PDF preview with inline iframe
   - Zoom button for full-screen view
   - Download button

## 💡 If You Want List Page Previews

If you want to add file previews/thumbnails to the reports list page, we can:

1. **Add thumbnail previews** - Small preview images for each report
2. **Add expandable preview** - Click to expand inline preview
3. **Add hover preview** - Show preview on hover

Let me know if you'd like to implement any of these options!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If file preview isn't working:

1. **Check if server is running**: `npm run dev`
2. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
3. **Check network tab** to see if file API calls are successful
4. **Verify file exists** in Google Cloud Storage
5. **Check environment variables** for GCS configuration

```

The file preview system is **complete and functional** - it's just located on the individual report pages rather than the list page.
