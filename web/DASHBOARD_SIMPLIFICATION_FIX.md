# 🔧 Dashboard Simplification Fix

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified**

**The Problem:**
- **Existing users with data**: Stuck in loading loops, can't access their dashboard
- **New users**: Blocked by complex onboarding system that hangs
- **Redirect loops**: Users bouncing between `/dashboard` and `/auth/signin`
- **Over-engineered onboarding**: Interfering with both user types
- **Database queries returning 0 results**: Despite users having data

**Root Cause:** Complex onboarding wrapper blocking ALL users

## ✅ **Simple, Clean Solution Applied**
