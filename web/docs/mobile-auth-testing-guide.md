```css
input {
  font-size: 16px !important;
}
```

### Issue: Keyboard Covering Input Fields
**Solution:** Implement viewport height adjustments
```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', handleKeyboardResize);
```

### Issue: Touch Targets Too Small
**Solution:** Ensure minimum 48px touch targets
```css
.touch-target {
  min-height: 48px;
  min-width: 48px;
}
```

### Issue: Session Not Persisting
**Solution:** Check localStorage and sessionStorage usage
```javascript
// Verify storage is working
localStorage.setItem('test', 'value');
console.log(localStorage.getItem('test'));
```
