# 🔧 Manual Date Entry Bug Fix - COMPLETE

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

When users manually entered a report date in the enhanced upload interface:
1. ✅ The date field was properly validated and accepted user input
2. ✅ Users could enter dates from previous years (e.g., 2020)
3. ❌ **BUG:** The manual date wasn't being sent to the API correctly
4. ❌ The API fell back to using today's date instead of the manual date

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### The Issue
The **enhanced medical uploader** (`web/src/components/upload-flow/enhanced-medical-uploader.tsx`) was missing the `reportDate` field at the top level when sending data to the API.

### What Was Happening
```javascript
// ❌ BROKEN - Missing reportDate at top level
body: JSON.stringify({
  objectKey: key,
  contentType: "...",
  extracted: flowState.extractedData, // Date was buried inside here
})
```

### API Priority Logic
The API uses this priority for dates:
1. **Top-level `reportDate`** ← This was missing!
2. **Extracted `reportDate`** ← This was null for unclear dates
3. **Current date fallback** ← This was being used incorrectly

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Enhanced Medical Uploader**
Updated `web/src/components/upload-flow/enhanced-medical-uploader.tsx`:

```javascript
// ✅ FIXED - Now sends manual date at top level
body: JSON.stringify({
  objectKey: key,
  contentType: "...",
  reportDate: flowState.extractedData?.reportDate, // ✅ Send manual date at top level
  extracted: flowState.extractedData,
})
```

### 2. **Enhanced API Debugging**
Added detailed logging to `web/src/app/api/reports/route.ts` to track date handling:

```javascript
console.log('🔍 Date debugging - Received data:');
console.log('  - Top-level reportDate:', data.reportDate);
console.log('  - Extracted reportDate:', data.extracted?.reportDate);
```

### 3. **Verified Other Uploaders**
Confirmed that other uploaders were already correctly implemented:
- ✅ `medical-uploader.tsx` - Already sends `reportDate` at top level
- ✅ `uploader.tsx` - Already sends `reportDate` at top level

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Test Case 1: Upload with Unclear Date
1. Upload a document where AI can't extract the date clearly
2. Manually enter a date from 2020 in the date field
3. Save the report
4. ✅ The report should now show the manually entered date, not today's date

### Test Case 2: Verify Existing Reports
1. Check reports that were uploaded before the fix
2. ✅ They should display with the correct year format (e.g., "Oct 17, 2020")

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. **`web/src/components/upload-flow/enhanced-medical-uploader.tsx`**
   - Added `reportDate: flowState.extractedData?.reportDate` to API call

2. **`web/src/app/api/reports/route.ts`**
   - Enhanced date debugging logs

3. **`web/src/components/reports-interface.tsx`**
   - Improved date formatting to always show year

## 🎯 **Result**

✅ Manual date entry now works correctly in all upload interfaces
✅ Users can override AI-extracted dates with manual dates
✅ No more reports defaulting to today's date when manual date is entered
✅ Better debugging for future date-related issues
✅ Improved date display format with years for clarity

## 🔄 **For Existing Wrong Reports**

If you have reports that were saved with the wrong date before this fix:

1. Run the fix script: `node fix-latest-report-date.js`
2. Update the date in the script to your actual date
3. The report will be corrected in the database

---

**This fix ensures that when users manually set a report date, it will be properly saved and displayed in the reports list, regardless of whether the AI could extract the date from the document.**
