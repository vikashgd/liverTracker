# Production Login Test Guide

## Authentication fixes have been deployed! ðŸŽ‰

### What was fixed:
- âœ… Simplified cookie configuration for production
- âœ… Fixed domain settings for livertracker.com  
- âœ… Added proper logout API route
- âœ… Disabled debug mode for production
- âœ… Cleaned up session management

### Testing Steps:

#### 1. Clear Browser Data (IMPORTANT!)
- Open your browser
- Go to Settings > Privacy/Security > Clear browsing data
- Select "Cookies and other site data" for livertracker.com
- Clear the data

#### 2. Test Login Process
1. Go to https://livertracker.com
2. Click "Sign In" or go directly to https://livertracker.com/auth/signin
3. Try logging in with Google OAuth
4. You should be redirected to the dashboard after successful login

#### 3. If Login Still Fails:

**Option A: Try Incognito/Private Mode**
- Open incognito/private browsing window
- Go to https://livertracker.com
- Try logging in

**Option B: Check Browser Console**
- Press F12 to open developer tools
- Go to Console tab
- Try logging in and look for error messages
- Share any error messages you see

**Option C: Check Network Tab**
- In developer tools, go to Network tab
- Try logging in
- Look for failed requests (red entries)
- Check if any auth-related requests are failing

#### 4. Verify Google OAuth Settings
Make sure your Google OAuth app is configured with:
- Authorized domains: `livertracker.com`
- Authorized redirect URIs: `https://livertracker.com/api/auth/callback/google`

### Expected Behavior:
- âœ… Login should work smoothly
- âœ… You should be redirected to dashboard after login
- âœ… Session should persist across page refreshes
- âœ… Logout should work properly

### If Issues Persist:
1. Check if the deployment completed (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. Try a different browser
3. Check if you can access the site at all
4. Let me know what specific error you're seeing

The authentication system should now work properly for your online production deployment!
