## 💡 Key Insights

2. **This is the correct UX pattern** - list pages show metadata, detail pages show content
3. **Performance optimized** - previews only load when needed
4. **Fully functional** - PDF preview, image zoom, download, error handling

## 🎯 Summary

The report preview functionality is **fully implemented and working correctly**. The confusion was about location - file previews are on individual report detail pages (accessed via "View & Preview" button), not on the reports list page. This is the standard UX pattern and provides better performance.

**To see file preview**: Click "View & Preview" on any report in the list → Individual report page shows full file preview in "Original Document" section.
