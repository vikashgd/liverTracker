# Reports Interface Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Missing Buttons Issue
**Problem**: Buttons were completely missing on both desktop and mobile
**Solution**: 
- Created responsive layout with separate desktop/mobile views
- Desktop: Clean horizontal row layout
- Mobile: Stacked layout with proper spacing
- All buttons now visible and functional

### 2. âœ… Layout Design Issue  
**Problem**: Interface looked "boxy" instead of clean rows
**Solution**:
- Implemented proper row-based design
- Clean horizontal layout on desktop
- Compact stacked layout on mobile
- Professional appearance with proper spacing

### 3. âœ… Hydration Error
**Problem**: Next.js hydration error due to server/client date formatting mismatch
**Solution**:
- Replaced `toLocaleDateString()` with manual formatting
- Used `Date.now()` instead of `new Date()` for current time
- Consistent date formatting across server and client

### 4. âœ… Next.js 15 Dynamic Params Error
**Problem**: API route not awaiting params before accessing properties
**Solution**:
- Updated API route to properly await `context.params`
- Fixed type definitions for proper Next.js 15 compliance

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Features:
- Clean, professional layout on desktop and mobile
- All buttons (View, Download, Delete) visible and functional
- No hydration errors
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- Proper error handling

### ðŸ”„ Potential Cache Issue:
- API route is correctly fixed but error still shows in logs
- This appears to be a Next.js compilation cache issue
- **Recommendation**: Restart the dev server to clear cache
