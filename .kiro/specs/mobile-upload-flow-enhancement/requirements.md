# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the medical report upload process by implementing a mobile-friendly, multi-step flow that replaces the current confusing single-screen approach. The new flow will guide users through upload, AI processing, review, and confirmation steps with clear visual feedback and smooth transitions, significantly improving the mobile user experience.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand that AI is professionally analyzing my medical images, so that I feel confident in the processing quality and know to wait for completion.

6. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL display error message with retry option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and edit the AI-extracted values before saving, so that I can correct any mistakes and ensure data accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN viewing extracted data THEN the system SHALL allow users to modify any field values
3. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
4. WHEN all required fields are valid THEN the system SHALL enable the "Save Report" button
5. WHEN the user clicks "Save Report" THEN the system SHALL save the data and proceed to Tab 3

### Requirement 5

3. WHEN on the success screen THEN the system SHALL display an "Upload Another" button

5. WHEN the user navigates away THEN the system SHALL maintain the success state until manually reset

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want intuitive navigation controls, so that I can easily move between steps and correct mistakes if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on Tab 2 or Tab 3 THEN the system SHALL display a "Back" button
