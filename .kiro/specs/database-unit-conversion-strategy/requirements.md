# Database Unit Conversion Strategy - Requirements Document

## Introduction

We have identified a critical architectural issue with our unit conversion system. Currently, we have a sophisticated unit conversion system that works at runtime, but we're storing unconverted data in the database and applying conversions during retrieval. This creates multiple problems:

1. **Complexity**: Every data retrieval point needs conversion logic
2. **Inconsistency**: Different retrieval paths may apply conversions differently
3. **Performance**: Runtime conversion on every query
4. **Maintenance**: Conversion logic scattered across multiple files
5. **Data Integrity**: Mixed converted/unconverted data in database

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Storage Strategy

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all medical parameters stored in standardized units in the database, so that data retrieval is consistent and reliable across all application components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a medical parameter is extracted or entered THEN the system SHALL convert it to standard units before database storage
2. WHEN a parameter is saved to ExtractedMetric table THEN it SHALL contain the converted value and standard unit
3. WHEN original values need to be preserved THEN the system SHALL store both original and converted values with clear labeling
4. IF conversion fails THEN the system SHALL store the original value with a flag indicating conversion failure

### Requirement 2: Data Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing unconverted data to be migrated to standard units, so that all historical data follows the same format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is executed THEN all existing ExtractedMetric records SHALL be analyzed for conversion needs
2. WHEN unconverted data is identified THEN it SHALL be converted using the established conversion rules
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed report of all conversions performed
4. IF migration encounters errors THEN it SHALL log failures and continue with remaining records

### Requirement 3: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be non-disruptive, so that existing functionality continues to work during and after the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is performed THEN existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function without changes
2. WHEN data is retrieved THEN it SHALL be in standard units without requiring runtime conversion
3. WHEN legacy data exists THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully during the transition period
4. IF rollback is needed THEN original values SHALL be preserved to enable data recovery

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Database Schema

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want the database schema to support both converted and original values, so that we maintain data provenance and audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing medical parameters THEN the system SHALL save converted value, standard unit, original value, and original unit
2. WHEN conversion is applied THEN the system SHALL record conversion metadata (factor, rule, timestamp)
3. WHEN data integrity is verified THEN the system SHALL validate that converted values are within expected ranges
4. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL flag records for manual review

### Requirement 5: Simplified Retrieval Logic

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data retrieval to be straightforward, so that I don't need to apply conversion logic at every query point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying ExtractedMetric table THEN the system SHALL return standardized values by default
2. WHEN original values are needed THEN they SHALL be available through explicit fields
3. WHEN building charts or analytics THEN no runtime conversion SHALL be required
4. IF debugging is needed THEN conversion history SHALL be accessible through audit fields

### Requirement 6: Conversion Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a quality assurance analyst, I want to track all unit conversions, so that I can verify data accuracy and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversion is performed THEN the system SHALL log the conversion rule, factor, and timestamp
2. WHEN data is migrated THEN the system SHALL create audit records for each conversion
3. WHEN conversion errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed error information
4. IF data discrepancies are found THEN the audit trail SHALL provide sufficient information for investigation

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to load data quickly, so that I can access my medical information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading dashboard data THEN no runtime unit conversion SHALL be performed
2. WHEN generating charts THEN data SHALL be retrieved in final format from database
3. WHEN displaying reports THEN parameter values SHALL be ready for immediate display
4. IF large datasets are processed THEN performance SHALL not degrade due to conversion overhead

### Requirement 8: Data Validation and Quality

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to trust that all parameter values are accurate and properly converted, so that I can make informed clinical decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameters are converted THEN the system SHALL validate results against clinical ranges
2. WHEN suspicious values are detected THEN they SHALL be flagged for manual review
3. WHEN conversion rules are updated THEN existing data SHALL be re-validated
4. IF data quality issues are found THEN they SHALL be reported through appropriate channels

## Technical Constraints

1. **Database Compatibility**: Solution must work with existing PostgreSQL/Prisma setup
2. **Zero Downtime**: Migration must not require application downtime
3. **Data Integrity**: No data loss during migration process
4. **Performance**: Migration should complete within reasonable time limits
5. **Rollback Capability**: Must be able to revert changes if issues arise

## Success Criteria

1. **Consistency**: All medical parameters stored in standard units
2. **Simplicity**: No runtime conversion logic needed in retrieval paths
3. **Performance**: Improved query performance due to elimination of runtime conversion
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for unit conversion logic
5. **Reliability**: Comprehensive audit trail for all conversions
6. **Quality**: All converted values validated against clinical ranges

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss Risk**: Preserve original values during migration
2. **Performance Risk**: Implement migration in batches with progress monitoring
3. **Compatibility Risk**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
4. **Quality Risk**: Implement comprehensive validation and testing
5. **Rollback Risk**: Create detailed rollback procedures and test them

## Dependencies

1. Existing unit conversion service (already implemented)
2. Database migration capabilities (Prisma migrations)
3. Data validation rules (medical parameter ranges)
4. Audit logging system (to be implemented)
5. Migration monitoring tools (to be implemented)
