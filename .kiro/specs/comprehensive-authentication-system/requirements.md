# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing a practical authentication system for the LiverTrack medical platform. The system will replace the current magic link authentication with standard email/password authentication and Google OAuth integration, providing users with familiar and convenient sign-in options while maintaining security for medical data access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standard Authentication Methods

**User Story:** As a user, I want familiar authentication options (email/password and Google sign-in) so that I can easily access my medical data without waiting for email links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL provide email and password input fields
2. WHEN a user wants to sign up THEN the system SHALL allow account creation with email, password, and basic profile information
3. WHEN a user prefers Google authentication THEN the system SHALL provide "Sign in with Google" option
4. WHEN a user signs in with Google THEN the system SHALL automatically create or link to existing account using email address
5. WHEN a user attempts multiple failed logins THEN the system SHALL implement basic rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### Requirement 2: Password Security and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure password management and recovery options so that I can maintain access to my account safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a password THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum security requirements (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)
2. WHEN a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide password reset via email verification
3. WHEN a user wants to change their password THEN the system SHALL require current password confirmation
4. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link with expiration
5. WHEN a user enters incorrect password multiple times THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account with clear recovery instructions

### Requirement 3: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable session management so that I stay logged in appropriately while maintaining security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session that lasts for 30 days by default
2. WHEN a user closes their browser THEN the system SHALL maintain the session for convenience (remember me functionality)
3. WHEN a user clicks "Sign Out" THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate the session and redirect to sign-in page
4. WHEN a user is inactive for 7 days THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for security
5. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to sign-in with a clear message about session expiration

### Requirement 4: User Account Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my account information and preferences so that I can keep my profile up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses account settings THEN the system SHALL display current email, name, and account creation date
2. WHEN a user wants to update their email THEN the system SHALL require email verification before making the change
3. WHEN a user wants to update their name THEN the system SHALL allow immediate updates with confirmation
4. WHEN a user requests account deletion THEN the system SHALL require password confirmation and show data deletion warning
5. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL remove all personal data within 30 days and send confirmation email

### Requirement 5: Google OAuth Integration

**User Story:** As a user with a Google account, I want to sign in with Google so that I can access the platform quickly without creating a separate password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
2. WHEN a user grants Google permissions THEN the system SHALL receive user's email and basic profile information
3. WHEN a Google user signs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new account using their Google email and name
4. WHEN an existing user signs in with Google THEN the system SHALL link the Google account to existing account if emails match
5. WHEN Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error message and fallback to email/password option

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive authentication interface so that signing in and managing my account is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL display a clean form with email, password fields and Google sign-in button
2. WHEN a user needs to create an account THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "Sign Up" link and form
3. WHEN a user makes an error THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages (invalid email, wrong password, etc.)
4. WHEN a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard with a welcome message
5. WHEN a user is on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that works well on small screens

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user storing medical data, I want my authentication to be secure and my privacy protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or updates passwords THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using secure algorithms (bcrypt)
2. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all communications
3. WHEN a user's session is created THEN the system SHALL use secure, httpOnly cookies for session management
4. WHEN suspicious login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
5. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication tokens and session data

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Platform

**User Story:** As a user of the LiverTrack platform, I want authentication to work seamlessly with all existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any protected page THEN the system SHALL verify authentication and redirect to sign-in if needed
2. WHEN a user uploads medical reports THEN the system SHALL associate the reports with their authenticated user account
3. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display data only for their authenticated account
4. WHEN a user shares reports THEN the system SHALL ensure only authenticated users can generate share links
5. WHEN a user accesses API endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate authentication for all protected routes

### Requirement 9: Mobile Compatibility

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want authentication to work smoothly on my phone and tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile browsers THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly authentication forms
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL support autofill for email and password fields
3. WHEN switching between mobile and desktop THEN the system SHALL maintain session continuity
4. WHEN on slow mobile connections THEN the system SHALL provide fast authentication with minimal loading times
5. WHEN using mobile keyboards THEN the system SHALL show appropriate input types (email keyboard for email field)

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear guidance when authentication issues occur so that I can resolve problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message without revealing whether email exists
2. WHEN network issues occur during sign-in THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages and retry options
3. WHEN Google OAuth fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and clear error explanations
4. WHEN account lockout occurs THEN the system SHALL explain the reason and provide recovery steps
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging while showing user-friendly messages
