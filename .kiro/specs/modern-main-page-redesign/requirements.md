# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the current main page from its outdated 90s-style design with emoji icons into a modern, professional medical platform interface. The redesign will focus on contemporary UI/UX patterns, professional medical aesthetics, and enhanced multi-page document capture capabilities for better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional or patient, I want a modern and professional-looking main page interface, so that I feel confident using a medical-grade platform for my health data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the main page THEN the system SHALL display a modern interface without emoji icons
2. WHEN the user views the feature highlights THEN the system SHALL show professional Lucide icons instead of emojis
3. WHEN the user interacts with buttons and cards THEN the system SHALL provide subtle animations and hover effects
4. WHEN the user views the page on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a fully responsive design optimized for touch interactions
5. IF the user has a modern browser THEN the system SHALL utilize contemporary CSS features like gradients, shadows, and smooth transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user with multi-page medical reports, I want an efficient batch camera mode to capture all pages in sequence, so that I don't have to take and upload each photo individually like the current single-photo mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Scan Multiple Pages" mode THEN the system SHALL open a batch camera interface distinct from single-photo mode
2. WHEN the user captures each page THEN the system SHALL display a live thumbnail grid showing all captured pages with page numbers
3. WHEN the user is capturing pages THEN the system SHALL show a page counter (e.g., "Page 3 of 10") indicating current progress
4. WHEN the user completes page capture THEN the system SHALL allow review and retake of individual pages before processing
5. WHEN all pages are captured THEN the system SHALL process them as a single multi-page report (like existing PDF functionality)
6. WHEN the user uploads PDFs THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality without changes
7. IF a page is blurry or poorly lit THEN the system SHALL provide quality warnings and suggest retaking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user uploading medical documents, I want clear visual feedback and guidance throughout the upload process, so that I understand what's happening and feel confident about data security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates an upload THEN the system SHALL display clear progress indicators
2. WHEN the upload is processing THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates
3. WHEN the user hovers over upload areas THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with smooth transitions
4. WHEN the user sees security information THEN the system SHALL display professional trust indicators instead of emoji locks
5. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with actionable next steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating the platform, I want intuitive quick actions and navigation elements, so that I can efficiently access different features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views quick action buttons THEN the system SHALL display them with professional icons and clear labels
2. WHEN the user hovers over navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback
3. WHEN the user clicks action buttons THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual confirmation
4. WHEN the user views the help section THEN the system SHALL present information in a clean, scannable format
5. IF the user is on a touch device THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements meet accessibility touch targets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user concerned about medical data privacy, I want to see professional security and trust indicators, so that I feel confident about the platform's credibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views security features THEN the system SHALL display professional medical-grade security indicators
2. WHEN the user reads about data processing THEN the system SHALL use professional language without casual emojis
3. WHEN the user sees privacy information THEN the system SHALL present it with appropriate medical iconography
4. WHEN the user evaluates platform trustworthiness THEN the system SHALL convey professionalism through visual design
5. IF the user has security concerns THEN the system SHALL provide clear, professional explanations of data protection measures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user taking high-resolution photos of medical reports, I want the system to handle large image files efficiently while maintaining quality for AI processing, so that my photos are processed accurately without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user captures photos up to 10MB in size THEN the system SHALL handle them without errors or timeouts
2. WHEN large images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL apply intelligent compression that preserves text readability for AI vision
3. WHEN the system compresses images THEN it SHALL maintain sufficient quality for accurate data extraction
4. WHEN processing multiple large images THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and prevent browser freezing
5. WHEN images are optimized THEN the system SHALL balance file size reduction with OCR accuracy requirements
6. IF an image is too large or low quality THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance for optimal capture settings
