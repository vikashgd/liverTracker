# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature merges two existing AI Intelligence sections on the medical dashboard into a single, unified, and enhanced AI Health Intelligence system. The goal is to eliminate redundancy, improve user experience, and create a more powerful AI-driven health analysis platform that combines the best features from both existing systems while adding new capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want a single unified AI Intelligence section instead of two separate sections, so that I can access all AI-driven insights in one cohesive interface without navigating between multiple similar sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN I SHALL see only one AI Intelligence section instead of the current two separate sections
2. WHEN I access the unified AI Intelligence THEN I SHALL see all features from both previous sections integrated seamlessly
3. WHEN I navigate through the AI Intelligence tabs THEN I SHALL experience a logical flow from overview to detailed analysis to actionable recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want enhanced health scoring that combines real-time assessment with predictive analytics, so that I can better understand both current health status and future risk trajectories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Health Overview tab THEN I SHALL see a comprehensive health score that includes both current status and trend predictions
2. WHEN I examine the health score breakdown THEN I SHALL see scores for liver function, kidney function, coagulation, and nutrition with predictive indicators
3. WHEN the system calculates health scores THEN it SHALL use data from both existing AI engines for enhanced accuracy
4. WHEN I view risk assessment THEN I SHALL see both current risk level and predicted risk trajectory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want unified insights and alerts that combine pattern recognition with clinical recommendations, so that I can quickly identify the most important health concerns and appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Smart Insights & Alerts tab THEN I SHALL see insights from both AI engines merged with enhanced explanations
2. WHEN alerts are displayed THEN they SHALL be prioritized by clinical importance and urgency
3. WHEN I view an insight THEN I SHALL see confidence scores, clinical relevance, and actionable recommendations
4. WHEN multiple insights relate to the same condition THEN they SHALL be grouped and cross-referenced

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want predictive analytics that show disease progression and future health trajectories, so that I can make proactive treatment decisions and monitor intervention effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Predictive Analytics tab THEN I SHALL see disease progression analysis combined with future forecasting
2. WHEN I view predictions THEN I SHALL see multiple scenarios (best case, likely, worst case) with confidence intervals
3. WHEN I examine risk factors THEN I SHALL see both current contributors and predicted future risks
4. WHEN I review intervention recommendations THEN I SHALL see projected impact on health trajectories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want advanced pattern intelligence that detects correlations and anomalies across multiple health metrics, so that I can identify complex health patterns that might not be obvious from individual metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Pattern Intelligence tab THEN I SHALL see advanced pattern detection across all health metrics
2. WHEN patterns are detected THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (correlation, seasonal, trend, anomaly)
3. WHEN I view a pattern THEN I SHALL see its clinical significance, strength, and affected metrics
4. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN they SHALL be highlighted with appropriate urgency indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want a personalized care plan that dynamically updates based on all available AI insights, so that I can provide targeted, evidence-based care recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Personalized Care Plan tab THEN I SHALL see comprehensive care recommendations based on all AI analyses
2. WHEN I view care recommendations THEN they SHALL be prioritized by importance and urgency
3. WHEN I examine target metrics THEN I SHALL see specific goals with timelines and monitoring schedules
4. WHEN new data is available THEN the care plan SHALL automatically update recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the unified AI Intelligence to maintain all existing functionality while improving performance and user experience, so that I don't lose any current capabilities during the merger.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the unified system is implemented THEN it SHALL preserve all features from both existing AI Intelligence sections
2. WHEN I use the unified interface THEN it SHALL load faster than the current two separate sections
3. WHEN I navigate between tabs THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and intuitive
4. WHEN I view the unified section on mobile devices THEN it SHALL provide an optimized experience with appropriate responsive design

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want consistent visual design and interaction patterns throughout the unified AI Intelligence section, so that I can efficiently navigate and understand the interface without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any tab in the AI Intelligence section THEN I SHALL see consistent styling, colors, and typography
2. WHEN I interact with similar elements THEN they SHALL behave consistently across all tabs
3. WHEN I view charts and visualizations THEN they SHALL follow the same design language and color scheme
4. WHEN I access actionable items THEN they SHALL be presented in a consistent format with clear call-to-action styling
