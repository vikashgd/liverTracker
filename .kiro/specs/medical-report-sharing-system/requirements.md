# Medical Report Sharing System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Medical Report Sharing System enables patients to securely share comprehensive medical data with healthcare providers through temporary, read-only links without requiring authentication. This system transforms the liver tracking platform into a comprehensive medical communication tool that facilitates better patient-doctor interactions, second opinions, and consultation preparation.

The system addresses the critical gap in medical data sharing where patients struggle to provide complete, organized medical information to healthcare providers, often resulting in incomplete consultations, duplicate tests, and suboptimal care decisions.

7. WHEN maximum views are reached THEN the system SHALL deny further access
8. WHEN accessing shared data THEN the system SHALL display confidentiality warnings and access logging notices

### Requirement 5: Share Link Management

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to manage all my active share links in one place, so that I can track, modify, or revoke access as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing share management THEN the system SHALL display all active share links with creation date, expiry, view count, and recipient information
2. WHEN managing a share link THEN the system SHALL allow copying the link, extending expiry, modifying access controls, or revoking access
