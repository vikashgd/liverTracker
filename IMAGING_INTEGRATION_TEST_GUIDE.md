   - ✅ Shows recent findings categorization

### **Test 2: Dedicated Imaging Page**

1. **Navigate via Menu**:
   - Click "🏥 Imaging Analysis" in the main navigation
   - Should go to: `http://localhost:3000/imaging`

2. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Full-page imaging dashboard loads
   - ✅ Enhanced imaging-lab correlations section
   - ✅ Clinical insights and recommendations
   - ✅ Medical disclaimers

### **Test 3: With Sample Imaging Data**

If you have imaging reports uploaded:

1. **Summary Cards Should Show**:
   - Total Reports count
   - Ultrasound count (🔊)
   - CT Scan count (💾)
   - Organs Tracked count (👁️)

2. **Organ Size Trends**:
   - Dropdown to select organ (Liver, Spleen, etc.)
   - SVG trend chart showing size changes
   - Data table with dates and measurements
   - Trend indicators (📈 increasing, 📉 decreasing, 📊 stable)

3. **Recent Findings**:
   - Categorized findings (Normal/Mild/Concerning)
   - Color-coded by severity
   - Modality badges (Ultrasound/CT/MRI)
   - Date stamps

### **Test 4: Imaging-Lab Correlations**

1. **Enhanced Correlations Section**:
   - Shows liver size measurements with nearby lab values
   - Correlates imaging dates with lab values within 30 days
   - Clinical correlation analysis

2. **Expected Correlation Data**:
   - Imaging date and organ size
   - Nearby lab values (ALT, AST, Bilirubin, Albumin, Platelets)
   - Status indicators (✅ normal, ⚠️ borderline, 🔴 abnormal)
   - Overall trend assessment (CONCERNING/STABLE/IMPROVING)

3. **Clinical Insights**:
   - Pattern analysis (concerning/stable/improving counts)
   - Medical recommendations based on trends
   - Appropriate medical disclaimers

### **Test 5: Empty State Handling**

1. **No Imaging Data**:
   - Should show friendly empty state message
   - Explains what imaging reports are supported
   - Lists benefits of uploading imaging reports

2. **No Correlations**:
   - Should gracefully handle missing lab data
   - Shows standard imaging dashboard without correlations
